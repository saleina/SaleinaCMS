# Saleina CMS

[![](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/saleina-cms/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/saleina-cms)

A CMS for static site generators. Give non-technical users a simple way to edit
and add content to any site built with a static site generator.

## How it works

Saleina CMS is a single-page app that you pull into the `/admin` part of your site.

It presents a clean UI for editing content stored in a Git repository.

You setup a YAML config to describe the content model of your site, and typically
tweak the main layout of the CMS a bit to fit your own site.

When a user navigates to `/admin` they'll be prompted to login, and once authenticated
they'll be able to create new content or edit existing content.
